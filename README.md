### How does this project fit with the strategy?

projectA is the first one of 26 projects from A to Z that I intend to develop on the way to become a full-stack developer.

projectA will last in one month from Aug 10 to Sep 10. Hope that it can contain basic knowledge of full-stack system development including front-end, back-end and devops.
