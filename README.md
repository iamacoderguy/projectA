### How does this project fit with the strategy?

projectA is the first one of 26 projects from A to Z that I intend to develop on the way to become a full-stack developer.

projectA will last in one month from Aug 10 to Sep 10. Hope that it can contain basic knowledge of full-stack system development including front-end, back-end, and DevOps.

## Problem space 
### Why are we doing this?
PROBLEM STATEMENT: Need for a system that requires basic knowledge of front-end, back-end, and DevOps to build.

IMPACT OF THIS PROBLEM: I have two years' experience of mobile development in Xamarin and that's it. My job is at risk. I can be fired at any time and it's hard to find a new one with Xamarin experience in my country. There are many things to learn, but not enough time for me for learning anything deeply. The best way for me to learn a thing is from practicing. So I would like to implement my ideas one by one to help me learn about the high-demand domain knowledge in my area. A system that requires basic knowledge of front-end, back-end and DevOps is a good starting point for me.

### How do we judge success?
The project will be finished if:
* I finish developing a system which involves a server (back-end) and one or more clients (front-end)
* The system can run, do one or more useful tasks and everyone can use it with some configurations
* The system doesn't need to run online, on-cloud. It can use a LAN.
* No master how many features the system has.
* The system must be continuously integrated and continuously delivered.

### Possible solutions
1. Play a mini game with an auto bot from the server
1. Play a mini game with friends via LAN
1. An authentication system (sign up and sign in).
1. Randomly show a random thing (such as motivation quote or video from Youtube).
1. File transfer between PC and mobile or PC and PC
